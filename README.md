## Our app **"TerraTechRobot"** is a creative tool designed to transform digital images into beautiful, physical flower patterns using robotics. ##

The process is simple and user-friendly:
1. The user uploads any image.
2. The system converts it into pixel art using a predefined color palette.
3. The user previews the result and confirms.
4. A special controller generates a `.bin` file containing movement and planting commands for the robot.
5. The robot plants real flowers based on the pixel art pattern — turning digital creativity into living ornament.

Whether you want to decorate a park, garden, or create a floral logo — TerraTechRobot makes it real.
